<h4 align="center">Wastco is an innovative project that aims to reduce waste in India by incentivizing people to dispose of their waste in the proper dustbins. The project encourages people to dispose of their waste in the appropriate dustbins by offering rewards for doing so. This way, people will actively take part in the initiative, and there will be no more waste seen in the surroundings. As per the project idea, people will be rewarded for disposing of their waste in the proper dustbins as per the terms and conditions applied. For instance, if a buyer purchases a water bottle from a particular shop and disposes of the product in the specific dustbin after consumption, they will be awarded the same product for free of cost if they do this several times. The projectâ€™s only motive is to make a clean and green India.</h4>
